# alleleFrequencyApp

This repository contains code for a Shiny App to support certain allele frequency calculations for the assessment & interpretation of rare genetic variants.  

A manuscript describing our approach to allele frequency assessment is available on [biorxiv](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/02/073114).   
You can see the app in action [here](https://jamesware.shinyapps.io/alleleFrequencyApp/).
